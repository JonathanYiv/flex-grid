# Grid Framework Project

This purpose of this project was to implement my own grid-based framework.
The framework should include:
* A CSS Reset ✓
* Gutters ✓
* Rows/Columns ✓
* Default Styling for Font ✓

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).
