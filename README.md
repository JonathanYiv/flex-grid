# Grid Framework Project

This purpose of this project was to implement my own grid-based framework.
The framework should include:
* A CSS Reset ✓
* Gutters ✓
* Rows/Columns ✓
* Default Styling for Font ✓

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be relatively exciting.

## Post-Project Thoughts

I didn't make a very complex grid.
I used flexbox and Normalize.css to meet the minimum project requirements.
Flexbox is very powerful.
I definitely want to try out CSS Grid combined with Flexbox going forward.

In addition, I know it's not exactly like the main site.
I'd need to download the custom font, change text colors, tweak font sizes, add some background colors and images, tweak the padding/margins, etc.
I feel I am confident in those actions, so I want to move onward.
